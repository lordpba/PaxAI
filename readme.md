## PaxAI Project
This project is an advanced AI system designed to propose solutions to war conflicts. It's written in Python and uses 3 AI Agents to define and manage tasks. Is insipired of the Magi system.

# Features
Conflict Analysis: The system can analyze technical data related to conflicts and extract conclusions.

Strategy Formulation: The system can formulate strategic plans based on current threats.

Ethical Assessment: The system can assess the ethical implications of proposed actions.

# Code Overview
The code excerpt provided shows the creation of three tasks:

scientific_analysis_task: This task involves analyzing technical data related to conflicts and extracting conclusions. 

strategy_task: This task involves formulating a strategic plan based on current threats.

diplomacy_task: This task involves assessing the ethical implications of a proposed action. 

# Example of final result:

Question: How to solve the Ukranian war?

1. Immediate ceasefire: All parties involved in the conflict must agree to an immediate ceasefire to halt any further violence and loss of life.

2. Diplomatic negotiations: Establish a structured diplomatic negotiation process involving representatives from all sides to address the root causes of the conflict and work towards a peaceful resolution.

3. Disarmament and demilitarization: Implement a comprehensive plan for the disarmament and demilitarization of all military forces in the conflict zone to reduce tensions and prevent future escalations.

4. International support: Seek international support and assistance from neutral parties to facilitate the peace process and ensure the implementation of the agreed-upon terms.

5. Economic and social recovery: Develop a plan for economic and social recovery in the affected regions to address the long-term impacts of the war and promote stability and prosperity.

6. Compliance with international laws: Ensure that all actions taken during the peace process are in compliance with international laws and respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all parties involved.

By following these guidelines and drawing inspiration from successful peace agreements in history, it is possible to achieve a balanced and acceptable solution that respects the rights and interests of all parties in the Ukrainian war conflict.
