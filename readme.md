PaxAI Project
This project is an advanced AI system designed to propose solutions to war conflicts. It's written in Python and uses a custom Task class to define and manage tasks.

Features
Conflict Analysis: The system can analyze technical data related to conflicts and extract conclusions.

Strategy Formulation: The system can formulate strategic plans based on current threats.

Ethical Assessment: The system can assess the ethical implications of proposed actions.

Code Overview
The code excerpt provided shows the creation of three tasks:

scientific_analysis_task: This task involves analyzing technical data related to conflicts and extracting conclusions. The task is assigned to an AI agent named Melchior and requires a search tool.

strategy_task: This task involves formulating a strategic plan based on current threats. The task is assigned to an AI agent named Balthasar.

diplomacy_task: This task involves assessing the ethical implications of a proposed action. The task is assigned to an AI agent named Caspar.

Getting Started
To use this project, you'll need to define your own tasks, agents, and tools based on your specific requirements. Once you've defined these, you can use the Task class to manage your tasks.

Future Work
This project is a work in progress. Future updates will include more detailed task definitions and additional functionality for managing tasks.
