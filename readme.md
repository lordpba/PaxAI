## PaxAI Project
This project is an advanced AI system designed to propose solutions to war conflicts. It's written in Python and uses a custom Agents to define and manage tasks. Is insipired of the Magi system.

# Features
Conflict Analysis: The system can analyze technical data related to conflicts and extract conclusions.

Strategy Formulation: The system can formulate strategic plans based on current threats.

Ethical Assessment: The system can assess the ethical implications of proposed actions.

# Code Overview
The code excerpt provided shows the creation of three tasks:

scientific_analysis_task: This task involves analyzing technical data related to conflicts and extracting conclusions. The task is assigned to an AI agent named Melchior and requires a search tool.

strategy_task: This task involves formulating a strategic plan based on current threats. The task is assigned to an AI agent named Balthasar.

diplomacy_task: This task involves assessing the ethical implications of a proposed action. The task is assigned to an AI agent named Caspar.

# Example of final result:

Question: How to solve the Ukranian war?
Answer: Action Plan to Address Ethical Implications in Diplomatic Initiatives for the Ukranian War:

1. Develop Clear Guidelines for Transparency and Accountability in Negotiations:
Delegate to Diplomat: Develop clear guidelines for transparency and accountability in negotiations regarding the Strategic Plan for Addressing the Ukrainian War. This involves ensuring that information is openly shared with all relevant parties, including the public where possible, and implementing accountability mechanisms to hold stakeholders responsible for their actions and decisions. Regular reporting and monitoring should be in place to maintain transparency and adherence to agreed-upon guidelines.

2. Ensure Impartiality and Effectiveness of Mediators:
Ask question to Strategist: How can we ensure the impartiality and effectiveness of mediators in the diplomatic initiatives for the Ukrainian War? Provide insights on best practices and strategies to ensure that mediators are unbiased, competent, and able to facilitate productive negotiations.

3. Prioritize Protection of Civilian Lives in Ceasefire Agreements:
Delegate to Scientist: Research and provide data on the best practices for prioritizing the protection of civilian lives in ceasefire agreements. This information will help in developing strategies to ensure that ceasefire agreements prioritize the safety and well-being of civilians in conflict zones.

4. Monitor Economic Development Programs to Prevent Exploitation:
Ask question to Diplomat: How can we effectively monitor economic development programs to prevent exploitation and ensure equitable distribution of resources in the context of the Ukrainian War? Provide insights on monitoring mechanisms and strategies to prevent the exploitation of vulnerable populations and ensure fair resource allocation.

5. Incorporate Ethical Theories and Frameworks into Decision-Making:
Delegate to Strategist: Incorporate ethical theories and frameworks into the decision-making process for the diplomatic initiatives in the Ukrainian War. This involves analyzing ethical considerations, applying relevant theories, and making decisions that align with ethical principles such as honesty, integrity, and respect for human rights.

By following this action plan and addressing the ethical implications proactively, we can work towards a just and sustainable resolution to the conflict in Ukraine while upholding transparency, accountability, and the protection of civilian lives.
