As a Crew Manager, I have delegated the task of conducting a military and logistic analysis of the real situation in the Ukrainian war to the Scientist co-worker. After thorough analysis, the Scientist has provided a comprehensive report outlining the latest military technologies and strategies being used in the conflict, as well as proposing a real and applicable peaceful solution that respects international laws and is balanced for all parties involved.

The detailed analysis and proposed solution have been compiled into a text file, which I will now review and present as the final answer to the original input question. 

Please see the attached text file for the complete content of the military and logistic plan for a peaceful solution to the Ukrainian war.
